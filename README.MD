# Project-2-Starter-Template

## Description

This repository is intented to be starter code for Project 2 MVC.

The minimum application desired is most similar to a TodoList application. 

Please visit https://todomvc.com/ for examples in various Javascript libraries/frameworks.

Your goal is to create a MySQL Database Driven website that has has a RESTful Application Programmer Interface (API).

The Front End should consume your API using GET, POST, PUT and/or DELETE routes using Javascript. Using jQuery/fetch API or other JS library.

Create a full CRUD for some resource, example given, Users and Posts, for a Social Media Website

Example:

MVP Social Media Website Clone

Users
1. Users should be able to sign up/create a profile
2. Users should be able to login and have a personalized experience with your website
3. Users should be able to update their profile
4. Users should be able to see Posts that they have created and linked to them

Posts
1. Logged in user should be able to write a Post
2. Users should be able to view another User's Post
3. Posts belong to a User and the Post table should have a Foriegn Key to associate the User that created the Post 

## Tips

1. Deploy to Heroku with JawsDB [Early]
2. After each feature, deploy and test it on Heroku
3. Decide to use Sequelize ORM or MySQL2 package early and stick with the decision
4. Create your database design and seed your database with 3-5 test entries, it is much easier to query against existing data
